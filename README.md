# NGS-Framework
A new simulation framework for the well-known CloudSim &amp; WorkflowSim simulators to predict a Runtime for Big Data workflow-NGS pipeline

# Project Overview
This version is up-to-date after getting a ValueTools-2017 acceptance of the paper.
It includes the real Data set (Input Data size & execution time) of running NGS pipeline. However, this new data set has been collected 
from Microsoft Azure Cloud of to improve the estimation of our Framework after adding a newly component to   the WorkflowSim & CloudSim.
The development is achieved by adding a specific unit of the I/O contentions solution.

# Software Requirements
Either Java version 1.6 or newer 

1- Installation and running the Simulator
This software is built on to of WorkflowSim, which is an extension of the CloudSim simulator. Where, we have adapted it to simulate the
execution behavior of the NGS pipeline as implemented in e-Science Central (e-SC). So, for more information you can visit the link
