# NGS-Framework
A new simulation framework for the well-known CloudSim &amp; WorkflowSim simulators to predict a Runtime for Big Data workflow-NGS pipeline

# Project Overview
This version is up-to-date after getting a ValueTools-2017 acceptance of the paper.
It includes the real Data set (Input Data size & execution time) of running NGS pipeline. However, this new data set has been collected 
from Microsoft Azure Cloud of to improve the estimation of our Framework after adding a newly component to   the WorkflowSim & CloudSim.
The development is achieved by adding a specific unit of the I/O contentions solution.

# Software Requirements
Java version 1.6 or newer
